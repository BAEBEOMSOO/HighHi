            Make way for Prince Ali!<br>
            Say hey! It's Prince Ali!<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar<br>
            Hey you! Let us through!<br>
            It's a bright new star!<br>
            Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!<br>
            Make way! Here he comes!<br>
            Ring bells! Bang the drums!<br>
            Oh! You're gonna love this guy!<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Prince Ali! Fabulous he!<br>
            Ali Ababwa<br>
            Genuflect, show some respect<br>
            Down on one knee!<br>
            Now, try your best to stay calm<br>
            Brush up your Sunday salaam<br>
            Then come and meet his spectacular coterie<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Prince Ali! Mighty is he!<br>
            Ali Ababwa<br>
            Strong as ten regular men<br>
            Definitely!<br>
            He faced the galloping hordes<br>
            A hundred bad guys with swords<br>
            Who sent those goons to their lords?<br>
            Why, Prince Ali<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He's got seventy-five golden camels<br>
            (Don't they look lovely, June?)<br>
            Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three<br>
            (Fabulous Harry, I love the feathers!)[2]<br>
            When it comes to exotic-type mammals<br>
            Has he got a zoo? I'm telling you<br>
            It's a world-class menagerie<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Prince Ali! Handsome is he<br>
            (There's no question this Ali's alluring)<br>
            Ali Ababwa<br>
            (Never ordinary never boring)<br>
            That physique! How can I speak<br>
            (Everything about the man just plain impresses...)<br>
            Weak at the knee<br>
            Well, get on out in that square<br>
            (He's a winner- He's a wiz- a wonder!)<br>
            Adjust your veil and prepare<br>
            (He's about to pull my heart asunder)<br>
            To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!<br>
            (And I absolutely love the way he dresses!)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys<br>
            (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)<br>
            And to view them he charges no fee<br>
            (He's generous, so generous)<br>
            He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies<br>
            (Proud to work for him)<br>
            They bow to his whim, love serving him<br>
            They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!<br>
            Prince Ali!<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Prince Ali! Amorous he!<br>
            Ali Ababwa<br>
            Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see<br>
            And that, good people, is why<br>
            He got dolled up and dropped by<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            With sixty elephants, llamas galore<br>
            With his bears and lions<br>
            A brass band and more<br>
            With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers<br>
            His birds that warble on key<br>
            Make way for Prince Ali!<br>
        </p></i>
